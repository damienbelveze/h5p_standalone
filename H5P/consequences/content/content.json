Do Large Language Models comply with this ideal? Mainly not because, huge resources are needed to host the datasets and the models used by AI, this kind of thing cannot be done only in somebody's garage. As Cory Doctorow puts it:<\/p>\n\n<p><em>But even the most \"open\" systems can't be independently replicated, due to raw computing requirements.

This moderation is part of major players' business such as OpenAI (see Part 5).
